## 📝 Program Description

Sunshine Scoops is a database-driven website developed for managing an ice cream shop's operations. Each database entity has its own dedicated page to streamline CRUD operations. Users can add new customers, register them in a rewards program, add new containers (cups, cones, dipped cones, etc.) and expand the menu items. The application manages customer orders, supports multiple suborders, and computes subtotals. The database follows the pre-planned ER diagram. It employs normalization techniques to optimize data organization and reduce redundancy. 

## ✨ Features

* **Data Normalization**: Applied techniques to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity.

* **Entity-Specific Management**: Each database entity has dedicated pages, simplifying CRUD operations.

* **Rewards Program Integration**: Register customers directly into a loyalty program and earn points with each purchase.
